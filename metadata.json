That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.\r\nAlongside history paintings, the early period of the Macchiaioli notably included the Castiglioncello School of landscape art, of significance in the 1860s in particular. (The school was named after the Tuscan coastal town where the artists gathered to work.) The painters of this school, among them Giuseppe Abbati, Odoardo Borrani, and Giovanni Fattori, constituted a homogenous subgroup within the Macchiaioli. At first Abbati's art was to the fore, subsequently that of Fattori.\r\nAbbati was very taken with the clear, serene light of that part of the country, and with the colours, and he was the most regular of the visitors. A typical painting of the 1860s was his Landscape at Castiglioncello.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ABBATI, Giuseppe/Country Road with Cypresses.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/abbati/abbati2.html", "title": "Country Road with Cypresses", "author": "\"ABBATI, Giuseppe\"", "date": "c. 1860", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 28 x 37 cm\"", "timeframe": "1851-1900\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "landscape", "description": "\n\n\r\nTo this day, the hilly Tuscan countryside is dotted with olive groves and ominous cypress trees, frequently found along roadsides and near cemeteries.

One example is this still-life.\r\nA dead partridge is hanging by its leg from a piece of string. Its wings and feathers, which are grey with brownish patches, open up towards us at the bottom like a fan. The fly on the light-coloured feathers has an illusionist effect: disproportionately large in size, it belongs to the realistic level of the picture rather than its fictitious one, so that the viewer is given the impression that a real fly is crawling across the painting. The bird's head has been pressed slightly towards the middle by the blue hunting bag with the golden fringe and the adjustable shoulder strap which is lying on the stone shelf. Beside the partridge a hunting horn, also adorned with tassels, and a powder bottle have been hung up. The shiny, metallic grey of the hunting horn has been painted by the artist with a highly sensitive eye for the different hues of the bird's fluffy, grey feathers on its breast and as a contrast to the grey of the wings which merges into white towards the middle.\r\nBut, although the bird has been rendered with almost unsurpassable precision, it has an odd abstract quality. It seems as if, in its material consistency, it had undergone a synthesis with the implement of civilization by which it was pursued - as if it was no longer merely part of nature and a victim, but an aesthetically refined and ennobled form of existence.\r\n\n\n\r\nSuggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Antonio Vivaldi: Concerto in B flat major RV 362 op. 8 No. 10 (Hunt)\n\n\n"}, "images/AELST, Willem van/Hunting Still-Life.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aelst/hunting.html", "title": "Hunting Still-Life", "author": "\"AELST, Willem van\"", "date": "c. 1665", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 65,5 x 52,7 cm\"", "timeframe": "1651-1700\n", "school": "Dutch", "type": "still-life", "description": "\n\n\r\nWillem van Aelst was a still-life specialist prized for his lovely flower and fruit pieces, and he has been mentioned as a sometime follower of Kalf.

The foreground of the painting is filled with sexual innuendoes. On the left side, a man shows a woman his strings of onions.

In the area around this town there was an extensive cottage industry for the processing of English cloth and the production of glassware, soap, sugar, and other goods. The changing conditions in agriculture were almost equally revolutionary. The population increase at the beginning of the 16th century meant a greater demand for food, which had to be satisfied buy an agricultural system that was now no longer catering merely to itself but also to the market.\r\nAfter years of inadequate supplies the increase in food production was experienced by the general public as a great improvement - so much so, in fact, that it virtually demanded some form of artistic expression. Celebrating this new wealth in an almost solemn manner, the Amsterdam-born painter Pieter Artsen, who lived in Antwerp in 1555-56, depicted market scenes as part of biblical illustrations. However, instead of following traditional conventions and playing only a minor part in these illustrations, these market scenes dominate the biblical motifs so much that the latter are literally pushed into the background.\r\nIn this painting Christ and the Adulteress, the biblical event takes place at the back, on the left, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene with peasants offering clay pots, baskets laden with fruit, vegetables such as onions, carrots, cucumbers and cabbages, as well as eggs, loaves of bread and large jugs of milk. It is this foreground which attracts our attention. There is also a peculiar mixture of time levels: the biblical scenario (with people wearing the clothes of antiquity) and the contemporary market scene (with sixteenth-century peasants) are intricately interwoven, as is shown in the Roman soldiers storming past the market stall. The same feature can be found in numerous other paintings of Aertsen.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/Christ in the House of Martha and Mary.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aertsen/christ_m.html", "title": "Christ in the House of Martha and Mary", "author": "\"AERTSEN, Pieter\"", "date": "-", "technique": "\"Oil on panel, 126 x 200 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Netherlandish", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nA kitchen scene combined with a religious subject is set within Renaissance architecture.

The sculptural silhouette with its powerful arms, its solid body and vigorously modelled face radiates a strong sense of assurance. The fact that she is looking towards the unseen part of the room suggests that something is going on there that the viewer is unable to see. Pieter Aertsen made use several times of this form of composition in which a single, solidly-built figure occupies the entire panel in a vertical format which accentuates his or her solidity. This is an invention by the artist, which although originating in the foregrounds of the works of Jan van Hemessen, has no real precedent in the Antwerp painting of the period.\r\nEven though he never painted a picture not containing a human figure, Pieter Aertsen played an essential role in the emergence of the still-life by granting a dominating place to objects and to victuals, which he represents in all their triviality. Whilst every element appears to have been observed with attention to real-life detail, the image has nonetheless been recomposed in the studio. What cook would place small fowls and a heavy leg of lamb on the same spit? We also find the same kitchen utensils, furniture and victuals, differently interlinked, in many of the artist's compositions. Whilst the household objects are drawn from life, the classical lines of the chimney are taken from the architectural treaty of the Italian Sebastiano Serlio, whom Aertsen would have known from the Antwerp edition of his works in 1549.\r\nThe total absence of religious subject matter, which still underlay all genre scenes at the time, is another stroke of daring by the painter, even if 16th century viewers would have immediately recognised, in the cook, the Martha of the gospel narrative, who is busy preparing the meal whilst her sister Mary is listening to Christ's words. This image also has a moralising content and should be read as a warning against the dangers of the pleasures of the flesh, \"voluptas carnis\".\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/The Cook.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aertsen/cook1.html", "title": "The Cook", "author": "\"AERTSEN, Pieter\"", "date": "1559", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 171 x 85 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Netherlandish", "type": "genre", "description": "\n\n\n\n"}, "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/The Egg Dance.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aertsen/egg-danc.html", "title": "The Egg Dance", "author": "\"AERTSEN, Pieter\"", "date": "1552", "technique": "\"Oil on panel, 84 x 172 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Flemish", "type": "genre", "description": "\n\n\r\nInteriors with merry companies or drunken brawls became very popular in the 17th century, and the work of Pieter Aertsen was seen as the first step on that path.

Before then scenes from everyday life had often been depicted in the background of pictures with a primarily religious content, but it was only after about the middle of the sixteenth century that many painters began to feel their principal task was to represent everyday life for its own sake. With Pieter Bruegel the Elder, also called Peasant Bruegel, genre painting came to be generally accepted and found a great many adherents in the Netherlands. Pieter Aertsen, who was born in Amsterdam and worked mainly in his native city and in Antwerp, was one of the most eminent of these. Most of his works depict market vendors, scenes at fairs or kitchen interiors, with an abundance of carefully painted still-life motifs.\r\nIn this painting he depicts an old Dutch peasant taking his produce to the market, on his head a heavy tub, in his right hand a brace of mallard and a basket of eggs. A peasant girl in the background kneels by a tray of pasties or loaves. The painter has achieved an effect of monumentality by using large spots of colour and clear outlines and by enclosing his powerfully modelled figures within the confines of a narrow space. Aertsen's great virtue lies in his sincerity and simplicity, particularly noticeable if we compare his work with later genre-scenes.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/Market Scene (detail).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aertsen/market1.html", "title": "Market Scene (detail)", "author": "\"AERTSEN, Pieter\"", "date": "1561", "technique": "Oil on wood", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Netherlandish", "type": "genre", "description": "\n\n\n\n"}, "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/Market Scene (1).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aertsen/marketsc.html", "title": "Market Scene", "author": "\"AERTSEN, Pieter\"", "date": "-", "technique": "\"Oil on oak, 127 x 85 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Netherlandish", "type": "genre", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis Market Scene - a painting in vertical format - shows a column of sea food on the left, building up and culminating in a ray and - directly opposite, on the right - a large number of fruits of the field and the garden. Wedged between this enormous abundance of produce, the farmer and his wife appear to be mere appendages whose job is only that  of proudly pointing with silent gestures to the victuals that are on offer.\r\nThe ostentatious wealth of fruit and vegetables in the market scenes of Aertsen and Beuckelaer may lead to the false conclusion that the population had plenty to eat. But although more was being offered on the markets, this did not meet the demands of the urban population, who had to pay exorbitant prices for agricultural produce in comparison to what they actually earned. And so, the horn-of-plenty motif of these market pictures reflects far more the perception of those who benefited, that is, the newly-rich farmers. In this way the artist emphasized the commercial aesthetics of agricultural products from the farmers' fields and gardens, products that were meant to arouse in the viewer the desire to buy, though not in the sense of present-day advertising.\r\nHowever, this does not exclude the possibility of ambivalent reasoning behind such paintings. While stimulating people's cravings and appealing to their needs, they often contained a subtle element of criticism, particularly in Aertsen's biblically motivated pictures. This criticism concerned the contradiction between people's consumer habits and the demand of temperance (\"fasting\"). While this critical element was still obvious in Aertsen's paintings, it seems to have disappeared almost completely in Beuckelaer's.\r\nThis painting has a multiple theme. The abundance of the market could be at the same time a representation of the Four Elements and an allegory of the Five Senses. Also the market woman is being pestered by a bird-catcher, who is gripping a duck round the neck with obvious erotic overtones - as well as a realistic representation. The painting is also a moral lesson, extolling moderation and restraint in contrast to the physical and sensual pleasured offered, for instance, in the plumpness of the fruit. In other paintings Aertsen introduced a religious scene in the background by way of admonition.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/Market Scene (2).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aertsen/marketsd.html", "title": "Market Scene", "author": "\"AERTSEN, Pieter\"", "date": "1560-65", "technique": "\"Oil on oak wood, 91 x 112 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Netherlandish", "type": "genre", "description": "\n\n\n\n"}, "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/Market Scene (3).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aertsen/marketse.html", "title": "Market Scene", "author": "\"AERTSEN, Pieter\"", "date": "c. 1550", "technique": "\"Oil on oak, 59,5 x 122,5 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Netherlandish", "type": "still-life", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe painting is an Ecce Homo fragment.

Allusions to the 'weak flesh' (cf. Matthew 16:41) may well have been associated with Aertsen's Butcher's Stall where - like on his fruit and vegetable stalls - a seemingly infinite abundance of meat has been spread out.\r\nIn this picture, the viewer's senses are immediately assaulted by the profusion of life-size comestibles. Amid fowls, sausages, beef, pork, fish, butter, cheese and pretzel, the eye of a flayed ox's head disconcertingly seems to watch the viewer. Each object is a masterful still-life. Like Lucas van Leyden and some other Netherlandish artists, Aertsen inverted the traditional foreground-subject relationship; his narrative occurs in the background. Almost unnoticed at first, the stall permits glimpses of a tavern on the right and a landscape behind. The ground around the inn is covered with oyster and mussel shells, which in some context - as here - allude to their consumption as an aphrodisiac. Among the tavern's revellers is a prostitute with a possible customer.\r\nMeanwhile, groups of people, dressed in contemporary Netherlandish attire, walk through the countryside towards the church visible at the far left. Only the mother riding the donkey stops to give alms to the poor. She is the Virgin Mary. Led by Joseph, she and her son are journeying to Egypt, to escape Herod. This is a very different presentation than the standard flight into Egypt since no idols fall, no miracles occur, no angels or servants direct the way. Although beset by their own troubles, the Holy Family shares what they have with the less fortunate. No halos signal their divinity, rather, Aertsen accented their humanity to construct a moral about daily personal decisions. His pilgrimage of life offers a choice between a materialistic and morally questionable existence on the one hand and the spiritual path of the Holy Family on the other.\r\nAertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer, his nephew and pupil, popularized peasant and market scenes such as this, which typically contain half-hidden moralizations and religious themes. Through their impetus in Antwerp and Amsterdam, where they painted, peasant and market scenes evolved into a separate artistic specialization around the mid-sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/Peasants by the Hearth.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aertsen/merry_co.html", "title": "Peasants by the Hearth", "author": "\"AERTSEN, Pieter\"", "date": "1560s", "technique": "\"Oil on wood, 142,3 x 198 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Netherlandish", "type": "genre", "description": "\n\n\r\nPieter Aertsen was a Dutch painter who had a workshop in Antwerp for several years. He painted altarpieces, but also peasant scenes with a moralizing undertone and kitchen still-lifes with religious themes in the background. He continued this work following his return to Amsterdam in around 1557, concentrating henceforth more on the latter genre. This painting may have been produced during his Amsterdam period.\r\nThe subject of the work has long been debated, although we can be sure it is not simply a peasant scene. it was once believed to be a portrait of the artist's family, but that hypothesis was rejected some time ago. The scene has all the elements of a rural booze-up. Much drink is being consumed, sausages grilled and bacon fried. There are festive biscuits on the table and a tray of waffles. Crowns like the one worn by the boy were used on the Feast of Epiphany, but also during other winter festivities, including Shrove Tuesday. Neither holiday is being celebrated here, however. The bird-cage next to the door on the left tells us that the scene is taking place in a house of ill repute, such as a tavern or brothel. Other elements combine to suggest the latter - the way the young man places his arm around the girl's waist, the copious eating and drinking, the aggression symbolized by the man with the two weapons, and the foolishness reflected by the king's crown. Like many of Aertsen's paintings, this work has both a moralizing and admonitory content, revealed by the presence of three men of different ages, each symbolizing a generation, around one woman.\r\nThere is some remarkable innovation in this painting. The figures in the foreground are shown full-length in the middle of the small space, which, together with the monumental format, testifies to the emancipation of non-religious themes in painting around this period.\r\n\n\n\r\nSuggested listening (streaming mp3, 26 minutes):Johann Sebastian Bach: Cantata BWV 212 (Bauernkantate)\n\n\n"}, "images/AERTSEN, Pieter/The Pancake Bakery.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aertsen/pancake.html", "title": "The Pancake Bakery", "author": "\"AERTSEN, Pieter\"", "date": "-", "technique": "\"Oil on panel, 87 x 169 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Netherlandish", "type": "genre", "description": "\n\n\r\nIn the 16th century pancakes and waffles were typical Shrovetide fare.

The difficult circumstances and the insecurity that reigned led the artists of the Capital to seek safer places and new markets. Crete, an island which had been under Venetian domination since 1210, and which was flourishing economically, was one such place. Archival sources mention at least six painters from Constantinople who lived and worked at Chandax (the medieval name for the present-day city of Herakleion in Crete) at the beginning of the 15th century; among them were John Apokaukos and Nicholas Philanthropenos. The wave of \"artistic migration\" which went on even after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453), led to the spread of the art of the Capital to the island and was a contributing factor in the creation of a particular school of painting, known as the \"Cretan School\", which was to dominate the art scene of the post-Byzantine years.\r\nAmong the artists who lived and worked at Chandax during this period, worth mentioning is the painter Angelos. More than 15 icons found today on Crete, Naxos, Patmos, Zakynthos, and in museums and private collections, bear his signature - \"cheir Angelou\" (by the hand of Angelos) - or are attributed to him on the basis of their stylistic features. The great number of icons leads us to suppose that Angelos must have had an important workshop in Chandax. Additional information on the painter is provided by the Venetian archives. In them there is a will, dated 1436, signed by one Angelos Akotantos, who has been identified with the painter whose name appears on the icons.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/AKOTANTOS, Angelos/The Congregation of the Archangels.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/akotanto/congrega.html", "title": "The Congregation of the Archangels", "author": "\"AKOTANTOS, Angelos\"", "date": "-", "technique": "Tempera on panel", "timeframe": "1401-1450\n", "school": "Greek", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\n\n"}, "images/ALBA, Macrino d'/Figure of a Saint.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/alba/figsaint.html", "title": "Figure of a Saint", "author": "\"ALBA, Macrino d'\"", "date": "-", "technique": "\"Oil on panel, 48 x 27 cm\"", "timeframe": "1451-1500\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\n\n"}, "images/ALBANI, Francesco/Spring (Venus at her Toilet).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/albani/1/1spring.html", "title": "Spring (Venus at her Toilet)", "author": "\"ALBANI, Francesco\"", "date": "1616-17", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, diameter 154 cm\"", "timeframe": "1601-1650\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "mythological", "description": "\n\n\r\nFrancesco Albani, an exponent of the classical ideal, chose a format for his four tondos which, in his own words, \"softened\" his pictorial expression.

He purchased a villa at Bassano Romano in 1595 which was then thoroughly remodeled and enlarged. The artists who painted there between 1595 and 1604 all worked in the Mannerist style.\r\nThe north wing of the enlarged palace was erected in 1607-09 and the painted decoration was accomplished in 1609-10. There are three rooms in the north wing, the Sala della Felicit\u00e0 Eterna (painted by Paolo Guidotti in 1610), the Sala di Diana (painted by Domenichino in 1609) and the Galleria (painted by Francesco Albani and assistants in 1609-10).\r\nIn the Galleria, Albani painted the legend of Phaethon, the youth who disrupted the path of the sun. The protagonists in Albani's wall pictures are seen reacting with violent gestures and upward gazes at the central event of the fall of Phaethon on the ceiling. The entire Phaethon legend, as related in Ovid's Metamorphoses, is illustrated on the ceiling and walls in episodes that are part dramatic, part lyrical. Albani designed the eight scenes on the walls as imaginary tapestries.\r\nAlbani's cycle was highly praised through the whole of the eighteenth century. Later the Phaethon cycle and its painter came to be forgotten, and have only now rediscovered by art historian and appreciated anew.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ALBANI, Francesco/The Phaethon Legend Fall of Phaethon and Olympian Gods.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/albani/2/phaeton2.html", "title": "The Phaethon Legend: Fall of Phaethon and Olympian Gods", "author": "\"ALBANI, Francesco\"", "date": "1609-10", "technique": "Fresco", "timeframe": "1601-1650\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "mythological", "description": "\n\n\r\nIn the Galleria, Albani painted the legend of Phaethon, the youth who disrupted the path of the sun.

Interestingly, the face of Elizabeth in the present work is no longer in shadow as it is in the Uffizi version.\r\nThe lateral figures may be the work of Giuliano Bugiardini, who is known to have rented quarters next to Albertinelli in 1503 and began assisting him shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ALBOTTO, Francesco/View of Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/albotto/campo.html", "title": "View of Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo", "author": "\"ALBOTTO, Francesco\"", "date": "c. 1745", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 61 x 97 cm\"", "timeframe": "1701-1750\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "landscape", "description": "\n\n\r\nFrancesco Albotto was a young assistant to Marieschi who imitated his master's style.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ALBOTTO, Francesco/San Giuseppe di Castello.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/albotto/giuseppe.html", "title": "San Giuseppe di Castello", "author": "\"ALBOTTO, Francesco\"", "date": "c. 1745", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 59,5 x 97 cm\"", "timeframe": "1701-1750\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "landscape", "description": "\n\n\n\n"}, "images/ALCIBAR, Jos\u00e9 de/Portrait of Mar\u00eda Anna Josefa Taking Vow.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/alcibar/v_josefa.html", "title": "Portrait of Mar\u00eda Anna Josefa Taking Vow", "author": "\"ALCIBAR, Jos\u00e9 de\"", "date": "1793", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 103,5 x 83,5 cm\"", "timeframe": "1751-1800\n", "school": "Other", "type": "portrait", "description": "\n\n\r\nAlcibar was a famous painter in Mexico in the viceregal period.

It was designed to house the \u201cApartments for Foreign Princes and Cardinals\u201d (Guest Apartments). It boasts the oldest painted decoration in Pitti Palace, commissioned from Alessandro Allori by Ferdinand de\u2019 Medici shortly before he became Grand Duke. In the centre of the vault, a trompe l\u2019oeil depicts a terrace that opens out under the sky and, along the balustrade, various female figures as they perform everyday activities. The highly naturalistic elegance with which animals and some items \u2013 such as the candelabras filled with numberless species of flowers \u2013 are shown, together with the sheer quality of the execution make this ceiling one of the most extraordinary examples of Florentine Mannerist painting in a private setting. In the centre of the vault, a pair of angels are lifting the Cardinal\u2019s coat-of-arms into the skies, surrounded by a wide variety of birds.

It exists in numerous versions, the best known being that in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence, painted for Grand Duke Cosimo II. The primacy of the version in the Royal Collection, however, depends principally on the vividness of the characterisation, the freshness of colouring, and the numerous changes effected during the course of painting even after several preparatory drawings had been made. Many of these changes are visible to the naked eye and accord with early descriptions of Allori's working methods. By contrast, the version in the Palazzo Pitti is slicker and more self-assured as a result of following an established design.\r\nThe painting's reputation is derived from the autobiographical aspect of the treatment of the subject as recounted by Filippo Baldinucci (1625-96) in his Notizie de' professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua. Baldinucci records that Allori was essentially a libertine who was given to occasional bouts of piety. Regarding the subject of the present picture he states that the figure of Judith is a portrait of the painters lover, Maria di Giovanni Mazzafirri (died 1617), known as 'La Mazzafirra' that the features of the servant are those of La Mazzafirra's mother, and that the head of the decapitated Holofernes is a self-portrait of the artist. In essence, the composition commemorates an unhappy liaison and symbolises the suffering that Allori experienced at the hands of La Mazzafirra.\r\nThe story of the Jewish heroine Judith, who saves her townspeople the Bethulians by cutting off the head of the Assyrian general Holofernes, is recorded in the Book of Judith found in The Apocrypha. The subject was frequently represented, sometimes as a straightforward narrative, sometimes with an allegorical (usually political) significance. The double meaning in the painting by Allori is confirmed by a poem by Giovanbattista Marino (La Galena, 1619), written in Paris where he saw one of the versions. Marino writes that Holofernes is killed twice, firstly by Cupid's darts and secondly by the sword. It is a theme that continues in literature certainly up to John Keats's La Belle Dame sans Merci. The female artists Lavinia Fontana and Artemisia Gentileschi depicted themselves as Judith, and there is an autobiographical element in the Judith by Jacopo Ligozzi of 1602 (Florence, Palazzo Pitti). Similar opportunities arose in the treatment of the subjects of David and Salome. Caravaggio, for instance, in the David and Goliath dating from 1605-06 (Rome, Galleria Borghese), used his own features for the head of Goliath. This last is a composition that Allori knew.\r\n\n\n\r\nSuggested listening (streaming mp3, 17 minutes):Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, oratorio, Part I (excerpts)\n\n\n"}, "images/ALLORI, Cristofano/Judith with the Head of Holofernes (1).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/allori/cristofa/judith_h.html", "title": "Judith with the Head of Holofernes", "author": "\"ALLORI, Cristofano\"", "date": "1615-17", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 139 x 116 cm\"", "timeframe": "1601-1650\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nCristofano Allori trained in the school of his father and his grandfather, the leading Florentine Mannerist Agnolo Allori, known as Bronzino. Even if Cristofano may be regarded as an artist who broke with late Mannerist tendencies and went on to become an express proponent of early Baroque reform ideas, he nevertheless continues to borrow certain traits of \"Mannerist physiognomy\" in order to heighten the effect of a picture. In his most famous painting, Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the extreme contrast between the dark and bearded head of Holofernes and the angelic face of his murderess owes much to the Mannerist school in which he was trained.\r\nAllori is said to have created a portrait of his mistress Mazzafirra in the figure of Judith and her mother in the figure of the elderly servant woman. The head of Holofernes may be a self-portrait. If this is true, the picture would certainly be a classic example of the so-called \"portrait histori\u00e9\" in which real figures are presented as figures from history. Whether or not this is true, the significance of this painting lies predominantly in the enormous erotic tension that emanates not only from the faces of Judith and Holofernes, but also from the sensuality with which the Old Testament heroine is portrayed. This major theme of triumph over tyranny had never before been presented from this point of view.\r\nThis is the only painting from the long neglected Florentine school of the seventeenth century whose reputation has always remained at the highest level, and it therefore gained a sort of symbolic value. Moreover, its fame as a masterpiece of the Seicento spread beyond regional borders, thanks in part to its temporary confiscation and subsequent display in the Mus\u00e9e Napol\u00e9on in Paris between 1799 and 1815.

The scene depicted in his Skating during Carnival takes place in Antwerp, identified by the walls built with Charles V and the Church of St. Jacques.

The man with horns and goat's feet is shown holding a club, while a blonde woman nestles against him and supports the child standing on her thigh. The couple seem to be oblivious of a scene taking place in a nearby meadow, where a woman in a red dress is attempting to flee from a naked man who is carrying a stick in one hand and holding her fast with the other.\r\nThe uninhibited way of life of human or semi-human beings in the freedom of natural surroundings was a frequently occurring theme in literary and pictorial works of the Renaissance, following the precedent of antiquity. German artists became familiar with subjects of this kind mainly through copper-engravings by Andrea Mantegna and other northern Italian artists. By no means all these themes were derived straight from antiquity; frequently they were mythological fantasies inspired by Roman relief sculpture.\r\nThe whole atmosphere of Altdorfer's idyllic scene suggests that it was inspired not so much by engravings as by the Arcadian landscapes of Venetian painters of the school of Giorgione; yet, although the motif of the naked woman seen from behind seems to confirm this, Altdorfer's approach to his art is fundamentally different. The satisfaction of depicting the nude, for which scenes from antiquity provided the most obvious pretext, is entirely subordinate in Altdorfer's paintings to his rendering of nature. The figures, which are fairly summarily treated, remain small and relatively inconspicuous against the dense wooded background. Whether the painter actually visited Venice is not certain but it does seem highly likely. About 1500 he was working in the Salzburg region at the Mondsee monastery, before he acquired burgher's rights in Regensburg in 1505. The present work, produced two years later, is one of Altdorfer's earliest signed and dated paintings. Like Cranach's Rest on the Flight, painted in 1504, it points the way to a new awareness of landscape in the Renaissance period, originally stemming from the so-called Danube school.\r\nAround the middle of the last century this portrait was in the Kraenner Collection in Regensburg; it later passed into the collection of Barthel Suermondt, which was purchased for the Berlin Gallery in 1874.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ALTDORFER, Albrecht/Landscape with Path.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/altdorfe/1/2landsca.html", "title": "Landscape with Path", "author": "\"ALTDORFER, Albrecht\"", "date": "c. 1518", "technique": "\"Parchment and wood, 42 x 40 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "German", "type": "landscape", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis painting represents one of the first landscapes in the history of European painting.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ALTDORFER, Albrecht/Danubian Landscape.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/altdorfe/1/3danube.html", "title": "Danubian Landscape", "author": "\"ALTDORFER, Albrecht\"", "date": "1520-25", "technique": "\"Parchment on wood, 30 x 22 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "German", "type": "landscape", "description": "\n\n\r\nWith a sentimental note and an intuitive science of light and colouring, the masters of the Danube school, Altdorfer and Huber, gave free rein to their lyricism in scintillating mythologies and religious scenes, in which the landscape acquires an importance never before equalled, and vibrates with a completely personal communion with nature.\r\nAltdorfer became a citizen of Regensburg in 1505, and later the Surveyor of the city's buildings.

Altdorfer dressed the Macedonians like German knights and landsknechts (mercenary foot-soldiers), while the Persian warriors sport turbans and exotic attires. Hundreds of riders and foot-soldiers skirmish within sight of their battle standards. Darius' chariot, with mounted steel blades, cuts a path through the throng. Alexander, riding on Bucephalus, and some of his knights are in close pursuit. Darius escaped but at great cost: according to the tablet above, 100.000 Persian soldiers and 10.000 riders died.

Several angels are playing in and around the basin of the fountain, and the child Jesus tries to reach into the water. The fountain-pillar is lavishly decorated with sculpture. The significance of the group of figures at the top - a bearded man with a boy shooting an arrow - is not clear, but appears to relate to ancient mythology. Beyond the fountain the wooded shores of a lake stretch far into the distance. The rocks are crowded with gateways, fortified roads and towers, houses with pointed gables, ruins and decaying roofs - all so intricately interwoven with trees and foliage that it is difficult to detect the relationship of any one building to the other.\r\nThe element of fantasy, which so dominates the landscape, is also apparent in the fountain, in which the figures seem to be drawn both from reality and from the artist's imagination. There is no prototype or parallel in Altdorfer's time for the bizarre appearance of the fountain. The painter's artistic invention was sin this case at least a generation ahead of his time.\r\nAt the foot of the fountain is a stone tablet bearing the Latin inscription: 'Albertus Aldorfer pictor Ratisponensis in salutem animae hoc tibi munus diva maria sacravit corde fideli 1510 AA' ('Albrecht Altdorfer, painter from Regensburg, for the salvation of his soul dedicated this gift to thee, divine Mary, with a faithful heart');.this indicates a very personal confession on the part of the painter, his appeal to the Virgin Mary. The dedication must also be taken as an explanation of the central feature of the picture, the fountain, which - though symbolic of a heathen place - is nonetheless the water of life for the Holy Family. The motif recalls the legend, according to which a spring appeared from the earth when the Holy Family in its flight sought a place to rest. A few years earlier Cranach had treated the same theme;this fact establishes a singular bond between the two paintings.\r\nIt is assumed that the landscape reproduces impressions from the country near Regensburg, and in particular the hamlets of Scheuchenberg, Lerchenhaube and W\u00f6rth, which are also recognizable in Altdorfer's Crucifixion in the gallery at Cassel. The painter settled in Regensburg in 1505 and twenty years later was appointed the city's master-builder. Most of his pictures point to a predilection for architecture and architectural d\u00e9cor. An example of this is the highly imaginitive construction of the fountain and - on another panel in Berlin painted somewhat later - the ruin in the darkness which serves as the setting for the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ALTDORFER, Albrecht/Rest on the Flight into Egypt (detail).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/altdorfe/2/02egypt1.html", "title": "Rest on the Flight into Egypt (detail)", "author": "\"ALTDORFER, Albrecht\"", "date": "1510", "technique": "Oil on panel", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "German", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nSeveral angels are playing in and around the basin of the fountain, and the child Jesus tries to reach into the water.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ALTDORFER, Albrecht/Nativity.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/altdorfe/2/03nativi.html", "title": "Nativity", "author": "\"ALTDORFER, Albrecht\"", "date": "c. 1513", "technique": "\"Linden panel, 36 x 26 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "German", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nStaged as a nocturne, this Nativity takes place in a stable so ruinous that an additional miracle may be found in its not having collapsed upon the Holy Family sheltering within.

Altdorfer painted several Crucifixions, but it is possible, on stylistic grounds, to date this version to around 1520. The symmetrical arrangement, with the cross in the centre of the composition, the crowd surging round it and the golden background (an unusual feature with Altdorfer) give the work a peculiarly archaic character.

The arch to each side contains a marble tomb: that on the left has a Piet\u00e0 painted above it and that on the right a Risen Christ with Two Angels. The spandrels at each end of the arcaded wall have an Annunciation, but all the other spandrels in the chapel are painted with roundels with half-length saints. On the west wall above the stalls is a fresco showing the donors Bonifacio Lupi di Soragno and his wife Caterina dei Franceschi presented by their patron saints to the Virgin and Child enthroned. The scenes painted above the stalls on the east wall and all the lunettes into the vault illustrate the Legend of St James, to whom the chapel was dedicated.\r\nThroughout the cycle, figures are conceived on a monumental scale and endowed with a narrative force and gravity of expression akin to Giotto. The convincing integration of figures and setting is remarkable. The treatment of architecture and its use in organizing compositions and describing space show an accomplishment not seen in earlier Italian painting. Buildings not only place the drama and set the scale but suggest space in several remarkable ways. Altichiero's naturalism is also apparent in portraiture: likenesses of contemporary figures including Petrarch, King Louis I of Hungary and the donors have been identified in the Council of King Ramiro, alluding to the cultural and political affiliations of the da Carrara, Lords of Padua.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ALTICHIERO da Zevio/View of the Cappella di San Giacomo (1).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/altichie/2/1view.html", "title": "View of the Cappella di San Giacomo", "author": "ALTICHIERO da Zevio", "date": "1376-79", "technique": "Fresco", "timeframe": "1351-1400\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe frescoes in the Cappella di San Giacomo (Chapel of St James) were commissioned by Bonifacio Lupi di Soragno and his wife, Caterina dei Franceschi.

This chapel was begun in 1372 in a privileged location inside the Basilica del Santo opposite the Cappella di Sant'Antonio (Chapel of St Anthony) and was completed, along with its painted decoration, in 1379.\r\nThe painting school of Padua can be ranked as the most vigorous of the northern Italian schools: the painters of Padua built upon Giotto's achievements.

Charmingly Rococo in taste are the small canvases too, usually with some mythological or courtly subject. A typical example of this type is the painting of 'Venus and Adonis', executed with arcadian grace in the sharpness of the composition and the clarity and softness of the colours soaked in a jewelled and diaphanous luminosity.\r\nThe story of Venus and Adonis, which has attracted not only artists but poets, including Shakespeare, tells that Adonis was the offspring of the incestuous union of King Cinyras of Paphos, in Cyprus, with his daughter Myrrha. His beauty was a byword. Venus conceived a helpless passion for him as a result of a chance graze she received from Cupid's arrow (Met. 10:524-559). One day while out hunting Adonis was slain by a wild boar, an accident Venus had always dreaded (Met. 10:708-739).

They attended the school of L\u00e9on Bonnat, or the Acad\u00e9mie Julian, or the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi. Some of them were tutored by  Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me. When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Gr\u00e8z-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods.\r\nIn due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark. Many Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish artists returned there every summer, to paint in the fine northern light in the company of friends old and new.\r\nAnna Ancher was a mistress of interior light and colour. She generally used her effects to establish a quiet, contemplative mood. The sensitivity and gifted colourism of her paintings created soulful, intimate atmospheres. In the present canvas, she uses the contrast of sunlight and the silhouettes of potted plants and window crossbars on the wall and floor. Her colour scheme is based on the contrasting blue of the wall and upholstery and the yellow of the curtains, an effect that is replicated in the blue smock and blonde hair of the girl sitting by the window.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANCHER, Anna Kirstine/A Funeral.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/ancher/anna/funeral.html", "title": "A Funeral", "author": "\"ANCHER, Anna Kirstine\"", "date": "1891", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 104 x 125 cm\"", "timeframe": "1851-1900\n", "school": "Danish", "type": "genre", "description": "\n\n\r\nAlong with Theodor Philipsen (1840-1920), Anna Ancher is regarded as the most important Impressionistic painter on the Danish art scene.

His masterpiece of this period is the polyptych, originally in the church of St Peter Martyr of Murano.\r\nAlthough conceived according to the traditional dividing up into compartments, with St Vincent Ferrer and St Roch in the centre, St Sebastian on the left, St Peter the Martyr on the right, and in the lunette the Madonna of Mercy with St Louis, St Dominic, St Bernardino and St Catherine, the palimpsest acquires a wholeness of vision through his confident mastery of perspective. Masters of the space within which they stand naturally on the gold ground, the figures have both a sculptural and a spiritual quality.

It may have been carried in civic or religious processions or have been made as a sign of  authority for a citizen-governor.\r\nImages of young David, who overcame seemingly insurmountable odds to kill the giant, were popular in fifteenth-century Florence, the smallest major power in Italy. The city saw itself threatened by such Goliaths as the pope, the duke of Milan, the king of Naples, and the doge of Venice. David's image is especially appropriate decoration for a shield since, throughout the Psalms, David's poetry echoes the notion of God as his shield: \"His truth shall be thy shield and buckler\" (Ps. 91.4).\r\nLike many early Renaissance artists, Castagno has presented the action and its outcome simultaneously: David holds the loaded sling, but already the head of the slain Goliath lies at his feet.

His style, shaped by his studies of the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, and characterised by an exquisitely balanced composition and high level of formal control, strongly influenced 16th Florentine painting, to such an extent that it was considered a precursor of Mannerism.\r\nAndrea del Sarto was commissioned to execute the Virgin and Child between Sts Francis of Assisi and John the Evangelist (called the Madonna of the Harpies) for the nuns of the convent of St Francis de'Macci. Within its solid and meticulous compositional structure, the artist almost seamlessly combines the typical pyramidal shape of the Virgins painted by Raphael with the statuesque feel of the figures created by Michelangelo, mellowing them with the delicate, shaded colours of Leonardo da Vinci.\r\nThe traditional title of the painting was coined based on Vasari's identification of the monsters depicted on the Virgin's pedestal as harpies. However, based on an iconographic interpretation of the work, which assigns an eschatological symbolism to the subject, today critics mostly agree that they depict the locusts described in St John the Evangelist's Apocalypse.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/Madonna of the Harpies (1).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/andrea/sarto/1/harpies0.html", "title": "Madonna of the Harpies", "author": "ANDREA DEL SARTO", "date": "1517", "technique": "\"Oil on wood, 208 x 178 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nPerhaps the most famous work of Andrea del Sarto is the altarpiece painted for the nuns of San Francesco dei Macci, known as the Madonna of the Harpies.\r\nAccording to the contract signed on May 14, 1515 the picture was to depict the Madonna and Child crowned by two angels and flanked by St John the Evangelist and St Bonaventure, and to be delivered within a year. But in fact the work is dated 1517, and shows St John the Evangelist and St Francis on either side of the Madonna and Child on a high polygonal pedestal. The latter is decorated at the corners with monster-like figures (the so-called Harpies), while in the centre, beneath the artist's signature, are the opening words of a hymn to Our Lady of the Assumption. We therefore have not the Coronation of the Virgin but the Virgin of the Assumption.\r\nThese variations on the original commission, and the subject itself, which is not a traditional Madonna and Child Enthroned between Two Saints, but a highly unusual presentation of the Virgin, full-figure on that enigmatic pedestal with the images of the \"harpies,\" have led to a lot of thought and attempted explanations on the part of all critics. The most recent interpretation is that it is a depiction, based on the text of the Book of Revelations, of the Virgin triumphant over evil, symbolized by the monstrous figures, the \"harpies,\" which are in fact the \"locusts\" mentioned in Revelations; and besides that, bears witness to the cult of the Virgin by the clients, the conventual Franciscans.\r\nHaving removed the layers of dirt and overpainting, the 1984 restoration has re-established the exceptionally rich colouring of the work, praised by Vasari as being \"of singular and truly rare beauty.\" The figure of the Madonna, wrought into a composed chiasmus in order to balance the weight of the Child (who on the other hand is lively, smiling, and as ambiguous as Rosso's putti), lights up the centre of the picture with the intense rose-colour of her robe tempered by harmony with the pale blue of her mantle, and with the brilliant yellow of the light fabric draped over her shoulders beneath the beautiful drapery of the white veil covering her head. On her left is the sculptural St John (painted from a terracotta model by Sansovino) swathed in a cinnabar red mantle linked to the lilac of his robe by means of a highly refined drapery, while on the other side the figure of St Francis strikes a clear note that emerges by subtle varieties of tone from the architectural motif of the background; while in the background one can once more see \"the smoke of transparent clouds veiling the architecture and the figures, that appear to move\" (Vasari): a warm, mysterious halo, made of colours and of shadows, that behind and around the figures impels an atmosphere that implies the rich spiritual message brought to us by this painting.\r\nThe Madonna of the Harpies is truly a milestone in the career of Andrea del Sarto, and bears witness to the level of maturity of the most significant artistic experiences of the early 16th century: the \"atmospheric\" painting of Leonardo, the meditation recently infused with a new freshness in the \"grandiose\" manner of Michelangelo, the elegant and solemn classicism of Fra Bartolomeo endowed with a new intensity of colour after his stay in Venice, the experience of Raphael's work in Rome (and in this case the Sistine Madonna is usually mentioned); these are all motifs that come together in a single stylistic solution, the greatness of which was immediately recognized in Florence and elsewhere. This general admiration was shared almost two centuries later by Prince Ferdinando de' Medici, who acquired the picture for his collection in Palazzo Pitti, offering the nuns in exchange for it not only a copy of the picture done by Francesco Petrucci, but also the embellishment, and practically the remodeling and restoration of all the decoration of their church by Foggini.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/Madonna of the Harpies (detail).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/andrea/sarto/1/harpies1.html", "title": "Madonna of the Harpies (detail)", "author": "ANDREA DEL SARTO", "date": "1517", "technique": "Oil on wood", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe figure of the Madonna, wrought into a composed chiasmus in order to balance the weight of the Child, lights up the centre of the picture with the intense rose-colour of her robe tempered by harmony with the pale blue of her mantle, and with the brilliant yellow of the light fabric draped over her shoulders beneath the beautiful drapery of the white veil covering her head.\r\nFor centuries - ever since a jjudgment by Vasari - the work was considered to be the prototype of classicism instilled into religious subjects, a refined synthesis of Leonardesque `sfumato', Raphaelesque balance, and plastic monumentality in the style of Michelangelo.

The impact and movement of Leonardo's figural composition have been moderated. Andrea's narrative is more human and touching; it reduces the heroic drama of gestures and figures. It shows a nearly enclosed hall, in whose articulations the row of apostles is embedded. The community at table with Christ is given a formal pendant in the form of a window loggia.

At the time of the siege of Florence in 1529 it was taken to safety inside the walls, to San Jacopo tra' Fossi, as were the two earlier paintings (Noli me tangere and the Annunciation).\r\nThe altarpiece features Sts Augustine, Sebastian, Lawrence, Peter Martyr, Francis and Mary Magdalen placed before an indistinct backdrop of sky and clouds resplendent with a compact image of the Trinity.\r\nThe subject of the picture is not rare in central Italian painting during this period of spiritual and religious debate. We need only mention the emblematic solutions provided by Raphael for analogous themes with the Disputation on the Sacrament in the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican, or the Ecstasy of St Cecilia, painted in 1514 for the church of San Giovanni in Monte at Bologna. Moreover, it was particularly congenial to the Augustinian clients of the monastery of San Gallo, who wished to present a theme dear to St Augustine, who is in fact depicted while leading a lively debate among other saints, in the presence of a stupendous Magdalene with the features of Lucrezia kneeling beside St Sebastian.\r\nWe get the best possible idea of the admiration aroused by the picture from the enthusiastic words of Bocchi: \"In this church there are three wonderful pictures by Andrea del Sarto: but the one on the right, with saints disputing about the Trinity, is of all pictures in all places the most wonderful. In this picture we see what a lively colouring, a drawing of rare quality, a unique mastery, can do. Who ever saw clothing so lifelike, or the reliefs of surfaces so marked, the features of persons so vivid, and liveliness so conforming with the truth?. . . It does not seem as if these figures were made of paint, but of flesh; not clothed by artifice, but by nature. But if for a moment we put aside the colours, and the artifice, we enter into the spirit of that which is true beyond any doubt; and it seems that the persons are thinking, and adopting bodily attitudes, and talking, and are anything other than painted.\"\r\nThe only additions one can make to this admiring judgment from the past arise from the recuperation of the exceptional colours of the Disputation, obtained by a restoration that has only just been completed. Apart from certain irreversible alterations, such as the oxidization of the verdigris spread by the painter on the mantle of St Sebastian in order to emphasize the effect of shadow in the folds, and apart from missing parts and abrasions caused by previous cleanings, the removal - or the careful and extremely prudent reduction - of the layers of dirt and coloured varnishes deposited over the surface in the course of centuries has enabled us to rediscover warm, intense and most refined harmonies of colour set against the deep blue-green space of a stormy sky. The \"palette\" now revealed to us appears very similar indeed to that of the Madonna of the Harpies, and confirms the theory that these two masterpieces date from the same time.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/Madonna della Scala.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/andrea/sarto/2/virgin_s.html", "title": "Madonna della Scala", "author": "ANDREA DEL SARTO", "date": "1522-23", "technique": "\"Oil on panel, 177 x 135 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe painting contains numerous exact quotations of Michelangelo and Raphael, though these are fused by Andrea in his own assured manner that gives form to a heroic and yet gentle humanity, and in an equilibrium that both enchants and involves the onlooker.\r\nThe structure of the painting, representing the Holy Family and the Angel, is complex and based on a pyramid: at the apex is the Madonna, kneeling humbly and lovingly holding the tender boy of the Child reaching out towards the angel, who, together with St Joseph, composes the base of the composition. The links between the group and the landscape are supplied by the horizontal line of steps. On this plane he has placed the powerful figure of St Elizabeth, who, according to a story in the apocryphal Gospels, is leading the little Baptist off by the hand in order to escape the persecutions of Herod, going towards the vast blue spaces of the hills and mountains.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/Assumption of the Virgin.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/andrea/sarto/3/assumpt.html", "title": "Assumption of the Virgin", "author": "ANDREA DEL SARTO", "date": "1526-29", "technique": "\"Oil on wood, 379 x 222 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis large altarpiece, called  Assunta Passerini, represents the miracle of the Assumption of the Virgin.

In the group of the apostles, we can identify St Nicholas and St Margaret, both kneeling, in the foreground. Looking towards the public, the first one wears a pink silk cope and is accompanied by the episcopal mitre, a book and the three golden spheres of the dowry which he gave to three poor young girls (his traditional attributes); St Margaret da Cortona is portrayed as a Franciscan tertiary, with a habit and a white veil. The presence of these two saints is explained by the commissioning of the painting: the altarpiece was in fact requested by Margherita Passerini between 1526 and 1528 for the high altar of Santa Maria dei Servi in Cortona. Both the father and the prematurely departed son of Margaret were called Nicholas, whose saint of reference is St Nicholas.\r\nThe altarpiece combines clarity and dimness, substance and dissolution, reality and vision, in a manner that suggests some of the development of the Italian Baroque that would follow in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANDREA DEL SARTO/Assumption of the Virgin (detail).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/andrea/sarto/3/assumpt1.html", "title": "Assumption of the Virgin (detail)", "author": "ANDREA DEL SARTO", "date": "1526-29", "technique": "Oil on wood", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe face of Mary in Andrea's huge Assumption bears the features of his wife.

The diverse saints on the pilasters, almost all bearing books, reflect the commitment to scholarship by the Order that shared by the Guidalotti.\r\nThe triptych was completely dismembered nearly two centuries ago, when its frame was destroyed, the panels cut apart and the predella dispersed.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Perugia Altarpiece.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/angelico/06/perugia0.html", "title": "Perugia Altarpiece", "author": "\"ANGELICO, Fra\"", "date": "1447-48", "technique": "\"Tempera and gold on panel, 128 x 88 cm (central), 102 x 75 cm (each side)\"", "timeframe": "1401-1450\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe picture shows the Perugia polyptych, without the complete predella.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Perugia Altarpiece (central panel).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/angelico/06/perugia1.html", "title": "Perugia Altarpiece (central panel)", "author": "\"ANGELICO, Fra\"", "date": "1447-48", "technique": "\"Tempera and gold on panel, 130 x 77 cm\"", "timeframe": "1401-1450\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis panel, representing the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Four Angels, was at the centre of a polyptych painted for the St Nicholas chapel in the church of San Domenico at Perugia.

The work is now displayed without its original frame, and the area which this covered can easily be seen along the upper edge of the panel. Compared with the Linaiuoli altarpiece, this Virgin is less monumental and the Child altogether more sinuous and fleshy. Angelico returns to the circle of angels to create an additional sense of depth, but here the two who would have stood forward of the throne have been replaced by three vases of flowers. The Virgin's throne is a solid classical affair with round arch and pilasters, topped with a swagged frieze.

Here, for the first time Angelico breaks away from the convention of the abstract, all-surrounding gold, and places the figures in front of a long table, whose end can be seen behind St Nicholas of Bari who has placed his mitre on it. This is not, however, so great a departure from convention as might be implied, as the table is covered with a golden cloth and beyond it is the usual gold background.\r\nThe two figures stand at the very front of the space created, St Dominic's foot and St Nicholas's vestments touching the edge of the step. St Nicholas wears his bishop's cope and supports his crook, while at his feet are three full leather bags. These refer to the most popular legend concerning this fourth-century churchman.

When Angelico took over the commission he found himself cribbed and confined by Monaco's ready-made triple-arched Gothic frame. He ignored these constraints, however, making skilful use of the three arches in his composition to provide a scene of stunning beauty and subdued yet poignant emotion, set in an expansive Tuscan landscape. Although the work is painted on one panel, the three arches of the frame find an echo in the placing of the figures in three groups.\r\nThe central arch is largely blocked off by the wooden framework of the cross and two ladders. The cross bar of the former appears to run behind the picture frame hinting at further, obscured space. With no scene behind but the sky and the lattice work of timber, the eye is drawn to the body of Christ which is at the very centre of the picture. Angelico challenges the tendency of the other two arches to define the shape and space of the work by placing a strong vertical, in the form of a tower or a tree, in the corners of each. The pilasters on either side of the frame contain twelve panels with full length portraits of saints, and eight medallions with portrait busts. The full-length figures are shown standing on columns which are each painted with careful attention to the view-point of the spectator.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Deposition from the Cross (detail).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/angelico/08/2trinita.html", "title": "Deposition from the Cross (detail)", "author": "\"ANGELICO, Fra\"", "date": "1437-40", "technique": "Tempera on wood", "timeframe": "1401-1450\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\n\n"}, "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Deposition from the Cross (detail) (1).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/angelico/08/3trinita.html", "title": "Deposition from the Cross (detail)", "author": "\"ANGELICO, Fra\"", "date": "1437-40", "technique": "Tempera on panel", "timeframe": "1401-1450\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe cross has no upper limb, thereby blunting the pointedness of the arch behind which it stands.

The heads of Moses and Elias appear beneath the arms of Christ; they are introduced as detached symbols to aid meditation.

The inscribed haloes identify the saints kneeling alongside the Virgin as Cosmas, Peter martyr and John the Evangelist, protectors of Cosimo, his oldest son, and his father, Giovanni di Bicci.\r\nThe Adoration of the Magi and the image of Christ as Man of Sorrows in the recessed tabernacle below met Cosimo's gaze once he ascended the stairs to Cell 39. Benozzo Gozzoli, whose style closely resembled that of Angelico, and an assistant painted these frescoes, as shown by the slightly awkward stance and proportions of some of the figures as well as by their linear, closely spaced facial features.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANGELICO, Fra/Corridor of the North Dormitory.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/angelico/09/corridor/0_view.html", "title": "Corridor of the North Dormitory", "author": "\"ANGELICO, Fra\"", "date": "1440-41", "technique": "Photo", "timeframe": "1401-1450\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe Medici chose the rising architect, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo to rebuild San Marco.

Michelozzo here adheres firmly to the Renaissance forms of Brunelleschi, even though his classicism has none of the other's passion for archeological research in it. The smooth, flowing lines of the cloister's arches create effects of light and shade which alternate in the series of vaults. Naturally the religious function and the deliberately spiritual effect of the structure, suggested by the order's Vicar General and perhaps by Fra Angelico himself, qualify these chiaroscuro and plastic impressions. The history of San Marco is inseparably linked to the figures of the painters, Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolommeo, and the friar Girolamo Savonarola.\r\nThe figure of Angelico dominates in the Convent.  The friar painter lived a long time here and expressed here his delicate and simple soul in the sincere, candid forms of art. But a great part, not only the artistic, but of the religious and civil history of Florence developed here.\r\nIn the cloisters, in the dormitories, in the cells we find the conventual character well-preserved in the harmonious architectural plan. We also find the memory of San Antonino, who entered here as a friar, and, it is said on the advice of Angelico, came out of it in 1445 archbishop of Florence; and the memory of Savonarola, who came here in 1489, and was later prior of the convent and who from here raised himself against the decadence of habits calling the people to liberty and democratic arrangement; and the memory, above that of Angelico's almost unknown collaborators, of a great friar painter, Fra Bartolommeo.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANGELICO, Fra/St Peter Martyr (1).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/angelico/09/marco4.html", "title": "St Peter Martyr", "author": "\"ANGELICO, Fra\"", "date": "1441-42", "technique": "Fresco", "timeframe": "1401-1450\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis fresco, generally attributed to Fra Angelico is located in the lunette above the entrance to the church of the Convent.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANGELICO, Fra/View of the chapel.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/angelico/10/1scenes.html", "title": "View of the chapel", "author": "\"ANGELICO, Fra\"", "date": "1447-49", "technique": "Fresco", "timeframe": "1401-1450\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis view shows the window (west) and entry (north) walls of the chapel decorated by Fra Angelico.

The one that involved the most work was the decoration of the small room in the ancient tower of Pope Innocent III that Nicholas V turned into his private chapel, a rectangular space with a groin vault. The floor installed at this time survives. It displays the emblem of Nicholas V, a radiant sun. The frescoes show scenes from the lives of Sts Stephen and Lawrence, in two horizontal bands. On the rear wall was a Deposition, also by Fra Angelico and mentioned by Vasari, but now lost. On the arches are the eight Doctors of the Church in Gothic aedicules. The Evangelists are on the vault, while on the window jambs rosettes with the head of Christ alternate with heads of patriarchs and prophets.\r\nThe cycle is generally attributed to Fra Angelico and his workshop. The hand of Benozzo Gozzoli has been identified in some of the scenes from the life of St Stephen. Painted for the jubilee of 1450, the cycle clearly reveals the program pursued by Nicholas V of a link between Christian and classical culture. Fra Angelico's figures have a \"Roman\" appearance: they stand solemn and serious, like heroes from antiquity, against a background of theatrical architecture, reminding the beholder of the buildings of ancient Rome.

On the predella the story of San Domenico is depicted.\r\nIn this altarpiece Fra Angelico departs markedly from his usual methods of space projection, but this can be explained by the extreme difficulty of integrating so complex a composition as a traditional Coronation, into the type of space he had recently employed. The whole, although still a heavenly scene, is set on terra firma. The sky is a realistic blue and not gold. The very low view-point enables the assembled saints and angels to be placed in a series of tiers without obscuring one another.

Perhaps of Flemish origin (he is cited as a Fleming in an eighteenth century inventory of the Valenti Gonzaga collection), he shows the influence of the Flemish landscape technique, with particular closeness to the work of Bril. His typical compositional characteristics are the rendering of a spatial depth, the showing of the horizon through an aperture in the dense foliage of the large trees, the domination of landscape over the relatively tiny figures, and the intense play of light and shadow.\r\nWorking in Rome probably between 1640 and 1650, Angeluccio was influenced by Swanevelt and Jan Both, and was an active member of the \"Bamboccianti\".\r\nThough Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi. Angeluccio seems to have furnished background landscapes for his fellow \"Bamboccianti\" much as Viviano Codazzi executed architectural backgrounds for them. A hypothesis has even been advanced that the nickname \"Angeluccio\" is derived from the closeness of this artist to \"Michele Angelo\" Cerquozzi. The fruits of this collaboration entered into numerous important Roman collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the inventories of which either report the pictures as \"by Angeluccio with figures by Cerquozzi\", or as landscapes by Angeluccio alone.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANGERMAYER, Johann Adalbert/Bouquet of Flowers with Animals.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/angermay/bouquet.html", "title": "Bouquet of Flowers with Animals", "author": "\"ANGERMAYER, Johann Adalbert\"", "date": "1704", "technique": "\"Oil on panel, 50 x 34 cm\"", "timeframe": "1701-1750\n", "school": "Bohemian", "type": "still-life", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis painting is the companion piece of Roelandt Savery's Bouquet of Flowers.\n\n"}, "images/ANGOLO DEL MORO, Giulio dell'/Ecce Homo.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/angolo/painting.html", "title": "Ecce Homo", "author": "\"ANGOLO DEL MORO, Giulio dell'\"", "date": "1598-1604", "technique": "Oil on canvas", "timeframe": "1551-1600\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis awkward but animated painting of Ecce Homo is perhaps the best painting of the artist.

Campi's gaze complicates matters, however, since as he paints he, too, looks out of the painting toward what the picture indicates must be his subject, Anguissola. Thus the viewer in front of the painting plays a double role: that of the subject of the painting within the painting, namely Anguissola herself, and of an engaged viewer - watched by both Campi and Anguissola - made complicit in Anguissola's destabilizing of contemporary social norms.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba/Portrait of the Artist's Sisters Playing Chess.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/anguisso/sofonisb/chess.html", "title": "Portrait of the Artist's Sisters Playing Chess", "author": "\"ANGUISSOLA, Sofonisba\"", "date": "1555", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 72 x 97 cm\"", "timeframe": "1551-1600\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "portrait", "description": "\n\n\r\nThat women could be intellectually accomplished and highly rational, even strategic, are the complementary themes of a family portrait showing Anguissola's three sisters playing chess.

The concept of Ansaldo's work may derive directly from a work by Luca Cambiaso that Ratti saw during the eighteenth century at the Palazzo Barberini. In his notes on Soprani's biographies of the Genovese Painters, Ratti described how \"in Rome at the Palazzo Barberini, there is a painting of the Virgin dressed in the manner of the gypsies, who flees to Egypt with the infant Christ in her arms\".\r\nTo support this hypothesis it is necessary to refer to two known Cambiaso paintings of the head of the Madonna with an identical attire, datable to around 1570, which may be smaller-format versions of the lost Palazzo Barberini picture. Even more closely related is a drawing of the Madonna of the Promenade showing the Virgin taking a stroll, wearing the same attire and large hat, and with the child held in a sling over her shoulder. Also similar iconographically and in other ways is a canvas of Bernardo Strozzi (Genoa; private collection). In the context of this connection, it is helpful to recall that Strozzi was in close contact with Ansaldo during the very years to which the painting has been dated.\r\nThe painting is dated to 1620-30, since its appearance can be connected to other works from Ansaldo's period of full maturity. The numerous stylistic sources that lie at the base of Ansaldo's mature style may be discerned in this work. Cross-breeding with each other and the aforementioned Cambiasesque currents, one recognizes the influence of Barocci (as seen through his Sienese followers Banni and Salimbeni), the well assimilated influence of Rubens, as well as that of Gentileschi, who was working in Genoa during the time that Ansaldo painted this picture.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANSELMI, Michelangelo/Virgin in Glory Flanked by Sts John the Baptist and Stephen.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/anselmi/virgin_g.html", "title": "Virgin in Glory Flanked by Sts John the Baptist and Stephen", "author": "\"ANSELMI, Michelangelo\"", "date": "1530s", "technique": "\"Oil on wood, 169 x 123 cm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\n\n"}, "images/ANTHONISZ, Aert/Sea Battle between Dutch and Spanish Boats.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/anthoni/seabattl.html", "title": "Sea Battle between Dutch and Spanish Boats", "author": "\"ANTHONISZ, Aert\"", "date": "1604", "technique": "\"Oil on panel, diameter 22,4 cm\"", "timeframe": "1601-1650\n", "school": "Dutch", "type": "historical", "description": "\n\n\r\nFollowers of Hendrick Vroom painted historical and quasi-historical maritime events in his style.

The arrangement is simple. Fifteen of the seventeen guardsmen have been lined up in two rows, with only a weak attempt to bind them together. Some of the men are looking towards the spectator, some of them elsewhere. This variety of movement slightly relieves the monotony of the setting, but it endangers the unity. The relief-like arrangement in planes parallel to the surface is characteristic of the Renaissance style. So is the accentuation of the straight horizontal and vertical directions, both giving a certain architectural firmness to the composition.\r\nAfter the middle of the sixteenth century painters of group portraits adopt a freer arrangement within a more natural space construction.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANTHONISZ, Cornelis/Henry VIII of England on Horseback.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/anthonis/henry8.html", "title": "Henry VIII of England on Horseback", "author": "\"ANTHONISZ, Cornelis\"", "date": "c. 1538", "technique": "\"Hand-coloured woodcut, 403 x 295 mm\"", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Netherlandish", "type": "portrait", "description": "\n\n\r\nAnthonisz painted this portrait of Henry VIII on horseback after the king had had his hair and beard cut short in 1535.

The works are attributed to Messina above all because of the strength of the new style of painting, claimed to have been inspired by a journey to Flanders. Still, the artist had his first grounding in the South of Italy. It was certainly here that he brushed shoulders with the Flemish painters and grafted onto his painting a new visual dimension, using colours to broaden space into more airy vistas.\r\nIn 1475 he was staying in Venice and the San Cassiano altar-piece came as a sequel to a series of works, including the Antwerp crucifixion, and a number of portraits. Designed round a novel architectonic skeleton, this canvas came to be the inevitable model and paragon for all the prestigious painters of the age, from Bellini, with his San Giobbe altarpiece, to Giorgione, the painter of the Castelfranco altar, and Alvise Vivarini, whose altarpiece was destroyed in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin in 1945.\r\nThis particular work of Antonello's, which had so significant an influence on his artistic career, and also on the history of subsequent Venetian painting, disappeared from the Church of San Cassiano in the first decades of the 17th century. Ridolfi mentions it in 1648. Reduced to fragments, it reappeared in the collection of the Archduke Leopold William in Brussels, and was attributed to Giovanni Bellini. About this time, Teniers made copies and engravings of them. In 1700 three or so of the large fragments found their way to Vienna. The two side-wings remained unrecognised until 1928, when they were put on show by Wilde. The Madonna was displayed, attributed now to Bellini, now to Boccaccino (Wickhoff, 1893 and Berenson, 1916-17); the latter was the first to identify in this picture the centre-piece of the San Cassiano altar. Finally Wilde managed to trace the two lateral fragments and tried to reconstruct the whole (1929).\r\nThis ambitious altarpiece was probably Antonello's most influential work. It has come down to us as a fragment, although by means of old copies, the sensible reconstruction indicates that even before Giovanni Bellini, Antonello produced a characteristically Venetian altarpiece.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANTONELLO da Messina/Christ at the Column.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/antonell/christ.html", "title": "Christ at the Column", "author": "ANTONELLO da Messina", "date": "c. 1476", "technique": "\"Oil on wood, 30 x 21 cm\"", "timeframe": "1451-1500\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis late painting by Antonello was executed for private devotion.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ANTONELLO da Messina/Portrait of a Man (Il Condottiere).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/antonell/condotti.html", "title": "Portrait of a Man (Il Condottiere)", "author": "ANTONELLO da Messina", "date": "1475", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 36 x 30 cm\"", "timeframe": "1451-1500\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "portrait", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis portrait is one of the best among the (more than ten) portraits painted by Antonello.

Each one is symbolically represented by a startling and evocative juxtaposition of fruits and objects typical of that time of the year. Arcimboldo found this subject particularly congenial and often painted groups of pictures on a theme. Not only did he paint the four seasons, but also the four elements (Earth, Air, Water, and Fire).\r\nThe painting originally belonged to a series of the Four Seasons. Summer, the only dated picture of the series, carries the date 1563. For the first time, Arcimboldo composes heads from all kinds of objects, whose selection gives meaning to the allegory. As attested by among others, a maiolica plate from 1536, this compositional method was certainly not invented by Arcimboldo, but the sophistication and imagination with which the painter applies the themes in the picture-puzzles are a very personal achievement, and the many later copies serve to reveal in their weaknesses and simplifications Arcimboldo's true originality.\r\nIn the profile bust of Summer, the cheek and neck area are composed of a large peach, quince, garlic, white young onions, yellow beets and white eggplant; the mouth and lips are formed of cherries and the open peapod within imitates a row of teeth. The nose is a young wild cucumber and the chin is a pear; the eye shines as a glassy sour cherry between two small pears. The bulge of the forehead seems to be made of brown-skinned onions; even the eyebrows - a curved grain-ear - are not overlooked. On the temple are three hazelnuts in their covers, and in the place of the ear is a dried corncob. The ensemble is completed with a head covering, effectively a cap or a hat made of fruit and vegetables bedded in greenery, from which emerge oat spikes resembling a hat feather. The clothing in woven straw has a single artichoke and the woven signature and date sophisticatedly integrated into the composition as jewellery.\r\n\n\n\r\nSuggested listening (streaming mp3, 10 minutes):Vivaldi: Concerto in G minor RV 315 op. 8.

This particular series, which is now in Paris, had been commissioned by the Emperor Maximilian II for Augustus the Elector of Saxony.\r\nThe series of the Seasons in the Louvre differ from the original Viennese model in the nature of the support, with canvas taking place of wood. The majority of the known versions of the Seasons are painted on canvas. This support may have been chosen for the convenience of the transport for which these works were intended by the man who commissioned them.\r\nThe series in the Louvre is the only one to have a border formed of garlands of leaves and flowers around the heads. This feature is clearly a later addition as the greenery is depicted in a perfunctory fashion with a broader brush and in places clumsily superimposed on Arcimboldo's painting. It is assumed that it was added in the 17th century at the time of the restoration and enlargement of the original canvas.\r\nThe Italian art historian Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo (L'Idea del Tempio della pittura, Milan, 1590) described Arcimboldo's allegories as \"teste composte\" (composed heads). The underlying principle of these compositions is the use of elements from an object area which is clearly distinct from others and in such a way that they add up to a personified figure. The individual elements as such do not have any mimetic properties; they only receive them when they co-occur with others.\r\n\n\n\r\nSuggested listening (streaming mp3, 9 minutes):Joseph Haydn: The Seasons, Part 1 Spring, Introduction, aria and chorus\n\n\n"}, "images/ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe/Summer (1).jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/arcimbol/3allegor/2seaso2.html", "title": "Summer", "author": "\"ARCIMBOLDO, Giuseppe\"", "date": "1573", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 76 x 64 cm\"", "timeframe": "1551-1600\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "mythological", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe painting is one of the series representing the four seasons, all in the Louvre.

His arrangements are usually composed of flowers in the primary colours - red, yellow and blue - with white blooms. The artist also habitually painted with high quality pigments and achieved saturated hues of considerable intensity, which gave his paintings great impact and a high degree of legibility when they shared the wall with other works in the richly decorated interiors of contemporary collectors. Unusually among Spanish flower painters, he frequently employed the expensive mineral pigment lapis lazuli in his blue flowers.\r\nAlthough Arellano absorbed some of the lessons of Italian and indeed Flemish flower painting, this mature work demonstrates that he developed a style that was entirely his own. The existence of a simplified replica of this painting (Madrid, Caja Madrid) demonstrates that the painter repeated successful compositions for the wide market to which his art appealed.\r\n\n\n\r\nSuggested listening (streaming mp3, 2 minutes):Franz Schubert: Blumenlied (Flower Song) D 431\n\n\n"}, "images/ARELLANO, Juan de/Basket of Flowers.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/arellano/07arella.html", "title": "Basket of Flowers", "author": "\"ARELLANO, Juan de\"", "date": "1668-70", "technique": "\"Oil on canvas, 84 x 105 cm\"", "timeframe": "1601-1650\n", "school": "Spanish", "type": "still-life", "description": "\n\n\r\nThis impressive still-life represents one of the finest achievements by the pre-eminent flower painter of 17th century Spain, Juan de Arellano.

The play of light and shadow on the face models it and gives it volume, while light also creates the different textures of the clothes, skin and hair, etc. \r\nThe sitter of this portrait was Tommaso Raimondi, a jurist and poet from Cremona. The artist is clearly interested in portraying his sitter as an individual, albeit by accentuating only his more flattering features.\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ASPERTINI, Amico/View of the Oratory.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aspertin/scene.html", "title": "View of the Oratory", "author": "\"ASPERTINI, Amico\"", "date": "1504-06", "technique": "Fresco", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "interior", "description": "\n\n\r\nThe picture shows a view of the long south wall with scenes 6-10 of the St Cecilia cycle. Above the entrance on the west wall is the balcony which abuts the Bentivoglio family chapel in the adjacent church of San Giacomo Maggiore.\r\nSt Cecilia is one of the most famous Roman saints, although she is purely legendary. She is meant to have lived in the second or more probably the third century, but only appears in the tradition in the fifth and sixth centuries. A young girl of noble background, she was betrothed, in spite  of her vow of chastity, to a noble Roman, Valerius. After the apparition of an angel in the marriage chamber, she converted the young man to Christianity and persuaded both him and his brother, Tibertius, to receive baptism. She then refused to make an offering to the pagan gods and was condemned to be suffocated in a boiler, but was saved by the descent of a refreshing cloud from the sky. She was then taken to be beheaded, but the executioner, even after three violent blows, could not detach her head. She lingered on, mutilated, for three days before expiring.\r\nThe fresco cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia consists of ten scenes from the legend of Saints Cecilia and Valerian, located on the north (scenes 1-5) and south (scenes 6-10) walls of the Oratory, which is connected by a passageway to the church of San Domenico Maggiore. The cycle, resembling a continuous frieze, is very different from the sort of painting normally found in parish churches. It bears a greater resemblance to the suites of canvases produced for Venetian oratories and assembly rooms.\r\nThe ten horizontal panels, each filled with life-size figures in the foreground, create the impression of a continuous pictorial narrative, one that is structured but not actually interrupted by the framing pilasters. The continuous background landscapes incorporate scenes from the legend of St Cecilia, a large part of which involves the conversions and martyrdoms of her husband Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. Also depicted are the Roman official Maximus, another convert, and Pope Urban I as the saints' protectors, who are soon afterward martyred themselves.\r\nThe predominant character of the cycle completely reflects the styles of the two masters who set the tone for the Bolognese school in around 1500, namely Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia. They must be regarded as the ones who devised the St Cecilia cycle, which was ultimately realized by collaborators whose names can no longer be determined with the exception of two panels with the signature of Amico Aspertini. The fact that the first pictures on each wall are by Francia would indicate that he was the supervisor of the project.\r\nThree pairs of scenes were executed by Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and Amico Aspertini. The author of the two other pairs are not known, here we present the reproductions of these scenes among the works by Francesco Francia.  \r\nThe scenes of the cycle are the following:\r\nScene 1: Marriage of Cecilia and Valerian (Francesco Francia)\r\nScene 2: Valerian with Pope Urban (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)\r\nScene 3: Valerian is Baptized (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)\r\nScene 4: Coronation of Cecilia and Valerian (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)\r\nScene 5: Martyrdom of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)\r\nScene 6: Burial of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)\r\nScene 7: Cecilia Disputing with Almachius (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)\r\nScene 8: Martyrdom of St Cecilia (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)\r\nScene 9: Cecilia Gives away Her Possessions (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)\r\nScene 10: Burial of St Cecilia (Francesco Francia)\r\n\r\n\n"}, "images/ASPERTINI, Amico/Legend of Sts Cecilia and Valerian, Scene 5.jpg": {"url": "https://www.wga.hu/html/a/aspertin/scene05.html", "title": "\"Legend of Sts Cecilia and Valerian, Scene 5\"", "author": "\"ASPERTINI, Amico\"", "date": "1504-06", "technique": "Fresco", "timeframe": "1501-1550\n", "school": "Italian", "type": "religious", "description": "\n\n\r\nScene 5 of the Cecilia cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia, painted by Amico Aspertini, depicts the martyrdom of Valerian and his brother Tiburtius.

Soon afterwards he was said to have travelled to Rome and remained there until about 1643-44. No painting can be documented to his Roman sojourn but on the basis of stylistic evidence a sufficient number establish he was there, and had close contact with the Bamboccianti as well as an opportunity to take a hard look at Claude's landscapes. Additionally, he made drawings, often animated with wash, of the grand and modest sights of Rome.\r\nAsselyn returned to the Netherlands via France where he married in Lyon in 1644-45. Then he moved to Paris where he worked with Swanevelt. By 1647 he was in Amsterdam where he spent the remaining five years of his life. During the brief period he specialized in Italian views saturated with silvery and golden atmospheric effect; he was one of the first to bring Claude's pure and light way of painting landscapes to Holland. He also painted winter and night scenes and views of his native land, and pictures of animals and birds as well. His Threatened Swan depicts a life-size swan defending its nest against a dog swimming towards it.\r\nWith menacingly outspread wings, the swan is vigorously defending its nest against the dog swimming up from the left. The scattered feathers and the low angle from which the bird is viewed emphasize its fury.\r\nThe painting was transformed at a later date into an allegory on the vigilance of the Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt by inscriptions added by an unknown hand: under the swan 'De Raad-Pensionarie' (the Grand Pensionary); on one of the eggs in the nest 'Holland'; and above the dog, 'de viand van de Staat' (the enemy of the State).
